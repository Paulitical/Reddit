If they can't help you, they probably can point you in the right direction.* 

*Edit 2: If your issue is with a business based in another state, you should still direct your complaint to your state's AG. Their mandate is to defend the consumer rights of you and your neighbors.*

If you listen to the (excellent) Reply All podcast, it's like Super Tech Support for your consumer rights. If you've been cheated by a business or you see a business cheating other people and want to do something about it, in many states you can file a complaint with your Attorney General's Office online in as little as fifteen minutes.

I've done this twice, once for myself and once for a friend. Most recently, I had an issue with T-Mobile's prepaid service. I was out $100 in service credit and unable to unlock my T-Mobile phone to use it with another service. Four hours at my local T-Mobile store resulted in nothing but impotent frustration. Three days after filing an online complaint with my state AG, I received a voicemail from a T-Mobile rep titled *Sr. Specialist, Executive Response:
A Division of the Office of the President*. It was a busy week for me, and I didn't get a chance to return his call, so one week later, I received an email from the same Sr. Specialist. He wrote that he had unlocked the device for me and would be sending a prepaid MasterCard loaded with the $100 I believed I was owed. I literally did *nothing* after submitting my complaint. My issue just fixed itself, as if by magic.

The first time I made a complaint to my AG was when I learned that a small local check cashing chain had sold my then-girlfriend a counterfeit item two years ago. When she tried to return it, they refused to refund her money. What really motivated me to complain was that two years later they were *still* advertising these worthless counterfeits and taking naive people for $80 a pop. After filing a complaint with my AG, the check casher volunteered to refund us the full $80 in cash, two years later, with no proof of purchase. A few weeks later, they also took down the posters advertising the counterfeit item.

Note that the complaint should be made with your *state's* AG Office, not the US Attorney General. The US AG will accept consumer complaints, but they do not provide the kind of hands on service that many state AGs do. Also, the zeal with which consumer complaints are pursued will vary from state to state. In Ohio, the AG provides a voluntary informal mediation process, and a complaint can conveniently be filed online. In contrast, the Wyoming AG requires that complaints be made by mail and is primarily interested in using those complaints to identify patterns of fraud and the like.

I literally did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; after submitting my complaint. My issue just fixed itself, as if by magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I made a complaint to my AG was when I learned that a small local check cashing chain had sold my then-girlfriend a counterfeit item two years ago. When she tried to return it, they refused to refund her money. What really motivated me to complain was that two years later they were &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; advertising these worthless counterfeits and taking naive people for $80 a pop. After filing a complaint with my AG, the check casher volunteered to refund us the full $80 in cash, two years later, with no proof of purchase. A few weeks later, they also took down the posters advertising the counterfeit item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the complaint should be made with your &lt;em&gt;state&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; AG Office, not the US Attorney General. The US AG will accept consumer complaints, but they do not provide the kind of hands on service that many state AGs do. Also, the zeal with which consumer complaints are pursued will vary from state to state. In Ohio, the AG provides a voluntary informal mediation process, and a complaint can conveniently be filed online. In contrast, the Wyoming AG requires that complaints be made by mail and is primarily interested in using those complaints to identify patterns of fraud and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

If you really keep in touch with your heart it helps you get through the day - during the hard parts of the day. Maybe getting up is hard for you. But if you think how great your re-stored 1957 Chevy will be if you work that extra overtime - then it is easier to get up.

But also there are dreams that motivate. And you should take inventory in private. You may have sexual dreams that are unethical - but still are there. For example maybe you like to have a hot, steamy affair with the pool man  - but you both have significant others ... and you both would be cheating. This could be a ""fantasy - will stay fantasy *dream*"" and then you have the real dreams like ""being President of USA"" that require you to work that extra day to pay your loans acquired during you studies for that degree .... KEEP that dream in mind. But write it down! 

**WHY WRITE IT DOWN?**

Good question. Why notes on the mirror? Do they really help you stay focused? Well look around the room where you are. OK? Look at all the writing you see. Start with logo on your computer or cell phone. Then look at the add on the buss. Then glance back down at the pop-up banner. Or see the add next to ""unsubscribe"" because you are disgusted with this kind of shit post. BUT there is a constant battle for your attention and focus. The moment you get up there are things designed to get your focus. So you need to create your own as you can. You know how much advertisers would like to be able to put notes on your bathroom mirror ? They would love it because it because they would have your attention. YES write it down. You need not put it on your mirror but you need to write it down to keep in proper focus. 

Somethings we are forced to take action on. We need to get our teeth cleaned - and the dentist will remind you. But who will remind you to take time for yourself to enjoy a walk in the garden in solitude that brings you such joy? You need to reflect on what makes you happy and make sure you keep it in mind - if it me a fantasy or a nuts and bolts or creating a taco stand. 

Here is an example of my list

1) Fantasy dream because it won't happen but would be enjoyable. I want to fly like Superman with my own powers.

2) I want to make love to my 4th grade teacher (in the past) ... another impossible fantasy.

3) Want to be president of the insurance company I work at. 

4) I want to write a book about the development of military tank and human interphase development. Very detailed.

At the end of a month, add up how many gallons of milk, pounds of meat, boxes of Cheerios etc you bought. Now you kinda have an idea of how much your family uses.

1) Compare prices at different locations. Next, check out the prices of things at different stores. Publix, Walmart, Aldi dominate the grocery supply where I live. Here’s a personal example. I’ve found that for store-bought Alfredo sauce, Bertolli is the best. This week it’s buy one/get one at Publix, but if it wasn’t, I’d get that product at Walmart because it’s cheaper. I look at Publix’s bogos specials for the week before I go shopping. Chocolate syrup is a full dollar cheaper at Walmart, so is rice and most canned goods.

2) Pay attention to price per pound. If Ground sirloin is $5.99/lb this week but beef tips are $3.99... guess what we’re having stew instead of burgers. If a whole roasting chicken is $1.29/lb that’s a better deal than $5.99/lb chicken breasts, plus that’s usually good for two meals AND you can boil the bones and skin with water to make delicious stock.

3) Use your freezer! I only buy bread when it’s BOGO, and then put it in the freezer. Good deal on butter or bacon? Buy two and freeze it for later.

4) Learn to actually cook Not follow some recipe that calls for a can of this and a pre-packaged that. Buy a ten pound bag of flour and experiment. I don’t buy frozen pizza anymore because I can make my own better. I give full credit to this feat to Chef John at FoodWishes and a lot of practice.

5) Spices and booze Buy in bulk and save, and shop around. Pay attention to mark-ups on what you normally drink. Local hippie grocery had good quality red wine for $7. Saw the same shit at Publix for $14.

Postscript I usually do soup, beans and rice, or other vegetarian meal twice a week. Buying in bulk what you would typically consume over the course of a month limits your trips to the store, and also limits the junk that might find its way into your buggy. Want cookies, make some don’t buy ‘em for $6!

I stupidly didn&amp;#39;t replace the surge protector, but kept fooling around and just replaced the power supply.  A little while later, both hard-drives with critical files went dead one morning.  I had the data backed up, but could have avoided the money outlay if I had been smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rule now is the replace wall-plugin type surge protectors every 3-4 years; and if you are in a place you own, consider installing a whole-house surge protection unit, which cost $200-300 installed, but last much longer and offer better protection.&lt;/p&gt;

You might not be thinking about your career, or have any particular job in mind. Trying to think about what to do with the rest of your life can even be scary, especially when you have lots of other things to think about. But they can usually help you in lots of other ways.

The main role of a careers service is to help you work out your options and prepare you for the first steps after education. The sooner you start speaking to your careers service, the more prepared you'll be for when you finish. Don't leave it until the last week when you're getting ready to graduate and have no idea what you're going to do!

All careers services are different, but some things they can help you with include:

* Learning how to reflect on what the skills you're developing through study and work
* Finding part-time work, placements and internships while you study
* Finding out about different career options that might be open to you, or careers that graduates from your subject have gone on to do
* Teach you about different careers and industry sectors
* Identify the kind of work you might be interested in based on your personality
* offer advice on applications and interviews (be it for a part-time job or graduate job)
* Show you ways to get some more skills on top of your studies, so that you can stand out
* Introduce you to employers through events and fairs

They're nice people, there's no pressure and they know it can be a difficult topic! But you'll be so glad you started using them sooner rather than later.

Bonus tip: If all you do during your studies is your degree/course, when you graduate you'll just have the same qualifications as everyone else applying for that same job that requires your degree.

Rehearse

Recall

Educate


Rehearse means you study a topic in regular intervals. maybe once every three days during the same time of day. Make this as consistent as possible. This way you don't need to cram everything in one day and the information stays with you longer.
I used cue cards. 3 piles, 1 for stuff i cant remember really well, 1 for stuff I can consciously pull up and the last 1 for stuff i know by heart. Space these three piles where the stuff you dont remember gets studied the most.

Recall is arguably part of rehearsing. You try to remember what you just learned. Theres something called overconfidence bias where you think you can do or know more than you actually do. In truth you're probably just dumb enough to think you know what you're doing. No offense, gotta be brutally honest with yourself with this one. 
Its also not just what you learned, but the specific topics you covered and what those topics branch out to. I used the chapter summary for my textbooks to chunk information into categories. Then chunk the subcategories in each one. Try relating things you already know to them. Like for me I used videogame min/maxing to conceptualize the stages of human development. I used to talk to myself out-loud and list the topics of the chapter. Sort of like creating computer folders in my brain.

The next is educate, or as my IT friend calls it, the rubber duck method. Pretend you're trying to teach a rubber ducky what you know about something and do it in a way that is simple enough that a rubber ducky will understand. Don't tell them I said this but rubber duckys arent the sharpest tool in the shed.
By doing this you'll conceptualize your understanding to think you already know of and you'll see where the gaps are in your knowledge when you don't know how to explain something.

1. Determine your ideal monthly lease (maximum payment you want to make, not including insurance).

2. Search for ideal cars via test drives and other criteria that may be important to you (within the reasonable price range of your ideal monthly lease). To get the best deals, lease the vehicle of the current year at the summer or winter sale. So if it’s 2018, lease a 2018 in summer or winter. 

3. Research every aspect of the car and make a final decision (color, mileage, lease terms, etc.).You can even narrow down the results to one or two cars in case one manufacturer provides a better deal than the other, assuming you are flexible with the brand. Researching every aspect is the key. You want to go into the dealership knowing exactly what you want and for how much you want it. 

Side note: DO NOT PUT A DOWN PAYMENT ON YOUR LEASE. A down payment is a scam. Yes it may lower your monthly and it only makes sense if you plan on purchasing the car after your lease, but it’s money that is essentially gone forever. What you should do instead is lease the car with a SECURITY DEPOSIT. You will receive the security deposit back at the end of the lease AND it will lower your monthly payment. It is essentially a refundable down payment, assuming you don’t damage the car so much that they won’t give the security deposit back to you. You want a $0 down, $xxxx security deposit lease. They are not the same thing and dealerships will try to confuse you or sneak in the down payment. 


4. Email (DO not call, DO not visit yet) dealerships and request information on the ideal car(s) that you want. I will explain why. They will insist on calling you, asking if they can call, or invite you to visit. If they ask, simply say no calls, only email. Provide the salesperson with the exact specifications of the car you are considering (including lease terms of $0 down, $xxxx security deposit) and insist they send you a monthly estimate via email. You want them to send you a number via email so you have written proof. This is valuable in negotiation.

5. Once you’ve received a few numbers, go to the dealership 4-6 weeks before their summer or winter sales (winter is ideal since end of the year sales are better) and meet with the salesperson that contacted you. Be kind and go over what you discussed via email, possibly considering alternatives that may be available. Let them sweet talk you and spend time with you. You already know which car you want, but act as if you are considering other options. Spend a good hour or two with the salesperson, learning as much as you can. Receive pricing (on paper) and specs about the car that you want and ask to take it home to help you make a decision (they will try to not give it to you since you can take it to other dealerships, but ask and they cannot refuse). Discuss your ideal car that you emailed about and lightly negotiate the monthly payment (if you can lower the monthly payment here a little, it’s a definite plus, but it’s not crucial, since you’re not leasing the car now). Say thank you and walk out after being there a while with the salesperson. Say you’ll be in touch. This is key. You’ve spent so much time with the salesperson that they are going to pursue you. You’ve essentially spent two or more hours with them and not bought a car. Take your paper and information and shop around at other dealerships, perhaps you’ll get a better offer for the same lease terms. If you do, restart the same process with the new salesperson. 

6. Sale time is approaching (in a few weeks). Your salesperson, if they’re good and persistent,  will have called or emailed you by now asking how you are doing, if you need more information, etc. Reply that the lease price is not acceptable and that you will wait, UNLESS they have a better deal right now. They won’t...just say it to emphasize your terms. You will not be an easy negotiator. 

7. Time to lease! It’s been a few weeks since your visit. Your salesperson should contact you and tell you they’ve got a deal for you, due to the summer or winter sales. If they have not, contact them in the last week of the sale and ask if they’ve got a deal for you. Accept their invitation and go in to lease when you’re ready. When you arrive, ask for your salesperson, and after exchanging some formalities, tell them you’re here because you’re expecting a deal. Sit down and review the numbers for the car you picked weeks ago. The monthly payment should be less now that it’s sale season. Review and review, and summarize the information out loud. - “So, for this car, a $0 down, $1900 security deposit, 12,000 mile, 36 month lease will get me $540 a month, assuming excellent credit?” Dealer will say yes, and so on. Act disappointed. Say you were expecting a deal and base the numbers off of the lowest estimate you received, either from another dealer or your initial email estimate. Spend some time, asking whether all the incentives were applied. Take a phone call, use the bathroom, make sure you stay there at least an hour, keep the conversation going and act as if you’re going to cave in and accept, but DO NOT. Salesperson will start to get exhausted. Ask if their latest monthly number is the best they can do and ask them to ask their manager. If it is the best number (assuming it doesn’t meet your ideal payment in step 1) say thank you and walk out. They will chase you and not let you leave. After all, you’ve met with and spent a lot of time with this salesperson. They do not want to let it go to waste. 

8. Return to the negotiation with your new lower number. This is where you have to be stern, confident, and direct. Tell them you will lease now if they’re monthly payment is $xxx. Low ball the lease considerably (but within range, don’t seem ridiculous). $499, go to $440. They will refuse, ask them to ask the manager. After they return with the refusal, ask them to lower the monthly. Use terms like “we’ve spent so much time” and “i’ll lease it now if you give me a lower number” and “let’s be fair.” They should return with a lower number. If they do or don’t, write a number down on paper that is slightly lower than the middle number between yours and theirs. So, the middle between $499 and $440 is $469.50. Write down $459, circle it and tell the salesperson to make the deal with the manager. If they make the deal, great. If they do not, meet them in the middle of your number and their number. Circle it and say “final price, only for today, this is my absolute maximum.” They should accept since it’s the last week of the sale month and they want to meet quotas and offload current year cars as next years cars are released. 

9. Shake hands, say thank you, review lease, lease car, smile. 

Bonus tips for best deal:
- lease car in current year at end of current year. 
2018 car at the end of 2018 
- lease car with previous recalls/problems (point of negotiation in your favor).
- lease car with unique/undesired color (unique or odd colored cars are more difficult to sell)
- lease manual car vs automatic (also more difficult to sell)
- lease with manufacturer you’ve leased with previously in order to gain loyalty benefits (also a point of negotiation).

But i had a run in with a dog this morning with no tags so please people. Preach it lol.

Story :Dropping my wife off for work.. I'm pulling out onto a busy county road, when I lock eyes with a young pupper. Being trailed by a leash and lead.. Tons of traffic, so I had to at least try to catch it (her).

After a short chase out of the traffic, which seemed to be a game to this young doggo 😑.. Got pupperinos(i'd  guess an 8-12month old female beagle, that was a little chubby 😂)attention between two houses and she started to approach me before she got nervous. Another bystander - a woman came to help and was able to lure her in the rest of the way. I think pupper was scared of my terrible masculine, stoner smoker voice.. but yeah. No fucking tags at all. 😣

Call ASPCA. Closed for hours. Humane society same thing... I almost took her home/hung out with her for a while.. But I have work shortly and ugh wasn't an option(if I were off I may have ""borrowed"" her for the day 😍). Anyway half hour or so after making the call, a young police officer is finally dispatched to the scene. He goes over the options/situation with me again, and I say I can't take her.. So she's hanging out with the local PD for a few hours..Til the humane society opens. Sigh, I feel bad. But she WAS collared, leashed and had a (broken) lead. She was young,healthy, friendly and happy. Not to mention, I believe a purebred beagle - no matter what I'm confident she will find her way home.. The same home? Yeah I hope so..

Had there been tags? I would have walked/carried her home myself. Unfortantly no pics because she had about as much energy as an atom bomb, and I spent most of the time holding her like a baby to prevent her from strangling herself, or running into the road. All while I was molested by kisses.. Eventually putting her down, she would head towards the road and the cycle repeated..Busy morning 😂

Here's what I did:

*    Don't panic. Your brain automatically triggers the fight or flight response during sleep paralysis, but you can separate the physiological response from the mental. If you panic, the experience will be several times worse. Focus on anything else: a song, or something or someone you feel a lot of affection for. Make it occupy your whole brain. This has been the most effective thing I've done.


*    Know you can't wake up out of sleep paralysis early. Fighting it frantically will increase the panic, and any amount of wiggling of toes will just remind you you can't move the rest of you. Sit still, relax, don't try to talk, don't breathe fast, and pretend it's your choice to do so. Combined with the first tip, just pretend you're chilling and thinking about something you like before you get up.

*    Know that any tutorial for lucid dreaming is a tutorial for sleep paralysis. You can get lucid dreams if you go to sleep during sleep paralysis, but you will get the sleep paralysis. Best avoided.

* Keep your eyes shut or sleep with something covering them. If you have visual hallucinations during sleep paralysis, get an eye mask. Don't give your brain material to work with.

*    Things like melatonin or anything that might be a sleep aid can make it more likely you'll have sleep paralysis.

*    If, while you're falling asleep, you have a strange ""swooping"" feeling in your head, like a heart missing a beat, it might be a warning sign you're about to have sleep paralysis. Get up and move around, drink some water, then try again.

*    If you're falling back asleep soon after having been asleep, or take a nap, it's more likely you'll get sleep paralysis.


* If you sleep on your back you're more likely to get it, and experience the ""sitting on chest"" feeling that often comes with sleep paralysis. Try side-sleeping.

*    If you've just had sleep paralysis, no matter how tired you are, go get up and do something else. If you fall back asleep after sleep paralysis there's a very good chance it'll happen again and worse.

If you panic, the experience will be several times worse. Focus on anything else: a song, or something or someone you feel a lot of affection for. Make it occupy your whole brain. This has been the most effective thing I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know you can&amp;#39;t wake up out of sleep paralysis early. Fighting it frantically will increase the panic, and any amount of wiggling of toes will just remind you you can&amp;#39;t move the rest of you. Sit still, relax, don&amp;#39;t try to talk, don&amp;#39;t breathe fast, and pretend it&amp;#39;s your choice to do so. Combined with the first tip, just pretend you&amp;#39;re chilling and thinking about something you like before you get up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that any tutorial for lucid dreaming is a tutorial for sleep paralysis. You can get lucid dreams if you go to sleep during sleep paralysis, but you will get the sleep paralysis. Best avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes shut or sleep with something covering them. If you have visual hallucinations during sleep paralysis, get an eye mask. Don&amp;#39;t give your brain material to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like melatonin or anything that might be a sleep aid can make it more likely you&amp;#39;ll have sleep paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, while you&amp;#39;re falling asleep, you have a strange &amp;quot;swooping&amp;quot; feeling in your head, like a heart missing a beat, it might be a warning sign you&amp;#39;re about to have sleep paralysis. Get up and move around, drink some water, then try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re falling back asleep soon after having been asleep, or take a nap, it&amp;#39;s more likely you&amp;#39;ll get sleep paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you sleep on your back you&amp;#39;re more likely to get it, and experience the &amp;quot;sitting on chest&amp;quot; feeling that often comes with sleep paralysis. Try side-sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve just had sleep paralysis, no matter how tired you are, go get up and do something else. If you fall back asleep after sleep paralysis there&amp;#39;s a very good chance it&amp;#39;ll happen again and worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

OneNote and Evernote are both designed for you to spend less time in your file system and more time paying attention.

If you don't like taking notes on a computer but you DO like to ACCESS them on a computer later, you need a [rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.com/). These things are so cool.


If you know of other good apps, please let me know in the comments! Especially for Apple users! I don't know very much about that sphere.
